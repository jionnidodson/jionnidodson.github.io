The module provides reports that save you time and enable you to gain the insights you need to make data-driven business decisions. If you also serve food at your bar and restaurant, chances are you'll need tablets and kitchen printers too.

<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>

It also features real-time analytics for sales tracking and other key performance indicators with actionable insights. Maybe your store makes many sales throughout the day that involve several smaller items, so a system with a scanner built into the counter might be more efficient.</p>

With the right system, the staff can manage inventory, purchasing, track sales, and generate business reports. Many restaurant POS solutions will even include inventory management and other business tools to make back-office functions easier.
