Once the connection is restored, Revel will automatically sync your new sales data with its archives in the cloud. This not only means that you'll be able to serve a greater number of guests in a shorter amount of time, but also that your staff members can spend more time interacting with your guests and VIPs instead of maneuvering back and forth through the crowd to access a central payment terminal.</p>

<p>A Point of Sale system enables cashiers to process transactions and serve customers efficiently, and allows managers to maintain tight control. The solution must have to offer intuitive order and payment flow which makes POS transactions snaps and let you manage customer and entire business effortlessly with less hassle. With the menu already in the POS system, servers can easily place orders, especially if that menu is intuitively organized specifically for your restaurant's workflow.</p>
<p>So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look.

Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
