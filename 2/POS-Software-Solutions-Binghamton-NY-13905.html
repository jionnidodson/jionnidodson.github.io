<p>Mobile-enabled and cloud-based omnichannel platform to speed up innovation and business change for midsize to large retail and restaurant businesses. Cash management is a significant feature of POS software systems, but there are other key functions. For smaller retail businesses, we recommend our new retail POS solution, Harbortouch Checkout HT Retail is designed for larger business environments like department stores, grocery stores, bookstores, beer distributors, or stores with over 10,000 SKUs. You can use them to monitor your business performance, cash flows, employee activities, order processing, inventory levels, and much more in real-time.</p>
<p>Anything that helps you streamline staff management—and potentially lower labor costs—is a plus. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this. Touch screen menus, remote ordering, staff supervision, automated billing, and organization of customer accounts are all possible with the restaurant point of sale software. However, if the system does not run reliably, it can cause serious headaches for both management and wait staff.</p>

<p>Start seeing sales, products, customers. For instance, the point of sale system can make more detailed reports, it improves the business' accuracy, and it can help the business keep track of its inventory. But with Shopify POS, you also get staff management functions, syncing between online and face-to-face sales and hardware integration with, for example, receipt printers and cash drawers. Building loyal customers is a sure-fire way to make sure your business is sustainable for years to come.</p>
