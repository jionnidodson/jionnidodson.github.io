<p>As the world is becoming cashless, more and more business are adopting cashless payment solutions, one of which is automatic payroll deduction. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs. The module provides reports that save you time and enable you to gain the insights you need to make data-driven business decisions. If you also serve food at your bar and restaurant, chances are you'll need tablets and kitchen printers too.
