A huge area of opportunity for restaurants and bars is accurately calculating variance (also known as shrinkage and loss) and lowering it. Bar inventory management software has up-to-date inventory.</p>

<h2>Best EPOS Software Dickinson TX</h2>
<p>Lightspeed is a great choice if you need to manage sales, inventory, and staff across multiple locations. This allows you to elevate customer service and improve turnaround time when customer orders are quickly entered front of house and immediately available to back of house for processing. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
<p>These provide retailers with tools ranging from order management and inventory tracking to customer management and payment processing for more seamless transactions. Every store is equipped with iPads that show their company website at all times to allow for cross-selling from other stores. Manage restaurant whole staff from a single application.

<p>Its menu intelligence leverages POS data and cloud technology to help you optimize menu and inventory management. Once the inventory code is entered, the systems call up the standard or sales price, compute the price at multiple quantities and provide a running total. To find the best POS systems for small businesses, we asked small business owners which systems they use and what they like and dislike about them.</p>
<p>Any form of payment can be used, such as cash, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and even accumulated loyalty points. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, or plan to expand your retail stores into the ecommerce space, then I highly recommend the Shopify POS system. On the other hand, the point of sale on the ecommerce platform is software working independent of hardware.

<p>Key features include order, stock and production management, sales statistics and takeaway and delivery management. For example, it offers barcode scanners, employee management tools, sales tracking, and inventory management, at a basic or enterprise level. Menus were easy to customize, and for our busy restaurant it's a perfect fit. This way, a user — whether they're a customer or staff member — can access and use these services whenever they're connected to the system.</p>
