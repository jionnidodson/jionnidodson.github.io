<p>When an owner is away from the business and wants to see how well a particular store is doing, all they need to do is login to the Internet POS on their smartphone. You need a complete, cloud-ready solution that supports every aspect of modern POS that your business requires, from hardware, operating systems, and application servers to database technology and industry-specific software. However, some vendors offer their own credit card processing service and bundle it with their POS software and hardware.</p>
