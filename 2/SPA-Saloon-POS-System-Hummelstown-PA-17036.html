It offers a choice of month-to-month or annual subscription plans for its POS software, and all of its plans support an unlimited number of users, customers and products. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
