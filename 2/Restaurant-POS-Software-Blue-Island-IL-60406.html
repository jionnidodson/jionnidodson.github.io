The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>
<p>Springboard is a powerful, cloud-based POS software and management system for retailers.
