<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>The system features automatic invoicing, barcode scanning, debit card PIN processing and digital receipts. A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software. Bluestore Live offers retailers a flexible point of sale system that can run on different hardware. We know how many hats business owners wear each day and created an ePOS software and eCommerce system that simply works well and works right, while enabling a competitive advantage.</p>

These systems will usually have online capability and instantaneously connect to the central main computer to update inventory as well as check the credit balance for credit card purchases.</p>
<p>When customers come back to try and reach your loyalty program's bonuses, they'll slowly start to feel that sense of belonging and being-at-home in your bar, which is the foundation for creating a regular bar customer.
