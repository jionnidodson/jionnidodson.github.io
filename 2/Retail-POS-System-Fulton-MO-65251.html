<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>With restaurant POS software, that can all be done using the tool. The point is to start with a checklist for evaluating restaurant POS systems. In addition to POS capabilities, it also comes with a Dine-In module to simplify table management, CRM, home delivery management, and live business dashboard. Whether your platform of choice is a traditional, PC-based point of sale system or a tablet POS system, the experts at pcAmerica can custom design a point of sale system to meet the unique needs of your business.</p>

Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.
