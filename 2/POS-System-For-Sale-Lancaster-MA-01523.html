Thrive POS provides a comprehensive suite of restaurant business solutions designed to increase top-line sales and decrease costs.

Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>

Such a capability will ensure that the bar menu updates in real-time and in accordance with inventory changes.
