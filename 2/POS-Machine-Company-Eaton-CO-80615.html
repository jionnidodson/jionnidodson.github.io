Tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations. Cova has a powerful reporting feature that provides detailed insights, including unusual cannabis sales or inventory patterns. You can easily accept cash payments as well as use credit cards, debit cards, etc.</p>
<p>With a kiosk module, you can set up tablets as self-service kiosks that customers can use at restaurants to place and pay for their orders and at retail businesses to scan and pay for their items.
