Tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations. Cova has a powerful reporting feature that provides detailed insights, including unusual cannabis sales or inventory patterns. You can easily accept cash payments as well as use credit cards, debit cards, etc.</p>
<p>With a kiosk module, you can set up tablets as self-service kiosks that customers can use at restaurants to place and pay for their orders and at retail businesses to scan and pay for their items. As technology has advanced, so have POS systems, with the introduction of bar codes in the 1970s, graphical interfaces in the 1980s, and online ordering in the 1990s. Valuable reporting insights, ingredient-level inventory, and easy ordering will save you time and money.</p>
