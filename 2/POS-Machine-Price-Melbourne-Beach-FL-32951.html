<p>It supports automated assembly systems, emails customers when their clothes are ready for pickup, and includes the Driver Mobile App for dry cleaning delivery and laundry routes. The retail stores are cozier and less stressful for shoppers. Manage and view customers' order history and personal information. Larger restaurants and fine dining establishments may need things like multiple server stations, hostess station systems, bar server stations and several kitchen printers, but as a small restaurant you do not.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
