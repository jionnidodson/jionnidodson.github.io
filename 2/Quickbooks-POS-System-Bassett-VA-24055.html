<h3>Salon Point Of Sale Bassett VA 24055</h3>
<p>The advanced POS solutions offer sales trends like seasonal demand in products and information related to stock management. Point-of-sale systems, or POS, are the retail software and hardware merchants use to process in-person transactions. POS once referred only to the site—typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.</p>
<p>Scheduling can be done manually or using an automated way by using data from past sales patterns and project labour requirement. Users can accept Debit and Credit cards all within the same application while capturing valuable customer data to use later with NCR Silver's marketing dashboard. Point of sale integration systems can allow transaction data overlays for multiple POS terminals. Many modern POS options also feature a customer display tablet that gives customers autonomy in placing an order and choosing a payment option.</p>
