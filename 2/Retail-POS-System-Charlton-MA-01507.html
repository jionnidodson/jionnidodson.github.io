<p>The only major complaint with QuickBooks is that it isn't recommended for many basic types of businesses, including full-service restaurants and retail stores with brick-and-mortar locations. There are hundreds of different kinds of retail management systems on the market. Internet disconnection is no problem as you can continue with your selling operation with the system automatically resyncing your sales when you get back online.</p>

Some sales people need to be reminded that this is your choice and that you will choose the system which is right for your business. Many small restaurants still operate on a cash-only basis.</p>
