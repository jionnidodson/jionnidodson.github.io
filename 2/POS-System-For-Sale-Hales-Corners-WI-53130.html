<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?) Talking to other business owners is a good way to get an idea of the range of what's out there in terms of price.</p>
<p>The system features automatic invoicing, barcode scanning, debit card PIN processing and digital receipts. A small business should not have to pay for an entire support division just for their point of sale software. Bluestore Live offers retailers a flexible point of sale system that can run on different hardware. We know how many hats business owners wear each day and created an ePOS software and eCommerce system that simply works well and works right, while enabling a competitive advantage.</p>

The best restaurant POS systems are so much more than order and till systems. As is based on the same platform as our Hostel PMS, the two systems are totally integrated - and all revenue postings from the POS are pushed to the PMS (regardless of folio charge or cash payment data).</p>
<p>User-friendly - The point of sale software should be easy to use so that you can manage it comfortably without consulting the manual regularly or depending on the tech support all the time.

Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
<p>As much as possible, go for a POS that can boost profits by providing a fast and efficient check-out process, manage inventory and sales reports, and provide income generating programs like loyalty rewards and discount promos. Cash registers are not as evolved as using a POS system and lack many of the functions and features of a modern day point of sale system like Square Point of Sale A cash register could be considered a point of sale solution technically, however, for our definitions, we will be focusing on point-of-sale machines (aka POS terminals) that involve both software and hardware.</p>
