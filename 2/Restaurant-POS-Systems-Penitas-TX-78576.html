<p>Mobile-enabled and cloud-based omnichannel platform to speed up innovation and business change for midsize to large retail and restaurant businesses. Cash management is a significant feature of POS software systems, but there are other key functions. For smaller retail businesses, we recommend our new retail POS solution, Harbortouch Checkout HT Retail is designed for larger business environments like department stores, grocery stores, bookstores, beer distributors, or stores with over 10,000 SKUs. You can use them to monitor your business performance, cash flows, employee activities, order processing, inventory levels, and much more in real-time.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
