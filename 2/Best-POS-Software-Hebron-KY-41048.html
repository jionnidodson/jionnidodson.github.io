POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry.

<p>Good retail management software should print barcode labels in two sizes and can automatically print a label for every item in the last shipment. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
