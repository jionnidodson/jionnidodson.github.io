<h3>How IPad POS Changes The Way Businesses Operate Browns Summit North Carolina</h3>
<p>Some basic restaurant POS functionalities like gift cards come at an extra cost. We also needed something that could provide an insightful overview of all of our stock, so we could see what we had to work with and effectively plan our in-store sales strategy. Reconcile sales, payments, costs of goods sold and accounting seamlessly. You have secure access to your data anywhere across multiple stores, and new features are always a free update away.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>

Once you have it installed it can take a little bit of time getting your items, customers, and employees into the system. Besides the office environment POS system also increases the efficiency of the everyday sales environment thanks to different POS features such as barcode scanners or credit card terminals.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
