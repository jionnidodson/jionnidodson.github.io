<p>All the Point of Sale systems serves the purpose of keeping a close track of daily sales. Shopify POS is an iPad and iPhone-based point of sale application that allows you to manage your entire online and physical store business using a unified platform. Having these options is mostly a no-brainer these days because you have access to all your sales and programming data online remotely or through an App. POS software records each sale when it happens, so your inventory records are always up-to-date.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
