<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. For a store that generates annual sales, the savings can be significant by utilising a POS system. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Omnichannel by design: Manhattan POS is equipped with all of the capabilities needed to turn stores into the center of your omnichannel experience: omni cart, omni fulfillment, returns, exchanges, cross-channel promotions, complete customer transaction and interaction history across channels, and more.</p>
<p>A functioning POS gift card program can also help retain customers. More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more. As the next-generation point-of-sale system, with cloud-based service, SaaS architecture, and bid data analysis, we help customers to achieve marketing, operations, management and all-round development of smart restaurants.</p>

Newer technology services on the market like cloud-based and hybrid point of sale solutions run on iPads and tablets where your data is synced and stored online and eliminates the need for an on-premise server like with legacy software and hardware.</p>

Manage customer loyalty programs, offer discounts and gift cards, or create promotional campaigns to turn one-time customers into advocates for your business. A CPU, motherboard and memory will form the PC unit of the POS Hardware bundle, with the combination of POS input device like POS keyboard, smart card or credit card reader and barcode scanner; and output device, like customer pole display, LCD screen or touch screen, and receipt printer, all bundle together to form a proper Point of Sale machine.</p>
