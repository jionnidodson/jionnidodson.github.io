<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell. For a while, on-site POS software has been the norm for computerised POS systems , but it is now more common to use cloud-based or hybrid systems relying on both the internet and local hosting. We've been assisting and simplifying the daily routine of retail businesses since 2001.</p>

<p>Inventory Efficiency: The POS system allows you to view sales reports immediately. Capturing data at the time and place of sale. The other benefit to handling tips through a sophisticated POS system is, when tax season rolls around, your bar point of sale software can create a report that shows exactly how much your customers paid in tips. Payments can also take place directly in the Restaurant POS. NorthStar from Custom Business Solutions is an iPad POS system for quick- and full-service restaurants, cafes, bars, amusement parks, and cruise lines.</p>
<p>Not only this, by using an efficient restaurant management software, you can avoid any embarrassments and possible loss of business that may be a result of overbooking, double-booking, or lags in customer service.

The POS is straightforward and simple to use, yet it is an attractive system with time-saving features managers find appealing. If you operate a business with multiple employees, your POS software can help you manage them even when you are not around.</p>
<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads. I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
