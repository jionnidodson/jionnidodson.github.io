<p>A Point of Sale (POS) system is indispensable for any type of retail business. Cloud-based Point of Sale software that easily adapts to support the evolving needs of customers. Some restaurant POS systems will even contain features to facilitate creating an online menu and delivery service that can be embedded into a website. Bar point of sale software also helps modernize your bar business by opening doors that grant access to cloud technology, mobile payments, and essential customer analytics data.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
