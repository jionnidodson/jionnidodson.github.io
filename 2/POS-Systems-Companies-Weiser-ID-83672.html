You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
