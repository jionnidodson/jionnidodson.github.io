<h3>What Is Point Of Sale (POS) Software Union South Carolina</h3>
<p>But first, let's look at the benefits of a POS system and how you can optimize this technology to manage your business. It also offers layaway options and gives you the ability to easily add store credit or park a sale. Two standardized software systems in common use for POS are JavaPOS and OPOS. Whether you choose a cloud-based or legacy system (on-premise), the best restaurant POS system manages all the business aspects of your restaurant.</p>
<p>For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards. OPUS automatically updates the sale and stock of the POS back to the retail ERP running at the head office. These applications would typically provide the same core functions, so watch out for other things like the hardware you would need to purchase on top of the software or which mobile platform it runs on. You would also do well to keep a keen eye on vendor reputation for providing timely updates and customer service.</p>

For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
