<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This means that, in order to access the capabilities that point of sale systems boast, you'll have to pay a fee to access the software that provides them.

This helps retailers keep track of their customers' purchases and allow them to serve them better.</p>
<p>Efficiently manage all your vendors, track invoices, and create purchase orders right from your retail software. Download the app for free and there is no monthly fee and credit card sales will appear in the merchant's account overnight.
