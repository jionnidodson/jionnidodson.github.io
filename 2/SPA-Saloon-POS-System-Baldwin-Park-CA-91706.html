<p>Agiliron is redefining retail point of sale. The system is accompanied by powerful hardware, including credit card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and label printers, to name a few. A POS system can increase profits by providing a quick and reliable check-out process, maintain detailed sales and inventory reports, and provide integrated profit increasing programs such as loyalty programs, coupons, and special discount programs.</p>
<p>Anything that helps you streamline staff management—and potentially lower labor costs—is a plus. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this. Touch screen menus, remote ordering, staff supervision, automated billing, and organization of customer accounts are all possible with the restaurant point of sale software. However, if the system does not run reliably, it can cause serious headaches for both management and wait staff.</p>
