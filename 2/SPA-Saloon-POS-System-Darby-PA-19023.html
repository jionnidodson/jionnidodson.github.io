It means a television set can keep your customers stay at your restaurant. The system will allow the bartender(s) in your business to spend less time on the POS screen. EzyPOS is a restaurant management system that requires minimum hardware to operate. A complete hospitality POS system (choose from cafe, restaurant, or nightclub and bar configurations) with all the hardware you need will run you $1,799.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer.

Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management. It is wise to use the POS computer for only sales transactions, reports, and inventory control, and isolate use of POS computers from general purpose activities.</p>
<p>Customer data capture and management are key in the development of our retail systems and Retail Pro allows for much improved processes and usability in terms of CRM and stock management. For example, having your inventory data visibility across stores means when your store is out of stock on a particular product, sales associates can check its availability at other locations. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
