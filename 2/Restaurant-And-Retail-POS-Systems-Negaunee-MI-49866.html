Accurate, real-time communications in Retail Pro help you keep your inventory and customer information up to date across the entire business, so you can make better decisions from holistic, integrated business insights.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well.

Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing.
