Accurate, real-time communications in Retail Pro help you keep your inventory and customer information up to date across the entire business, so you can make better decisions from holistic, integrated business insights.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing.

<p>This module powers centralized and automated inventory data that offers regular inventory checks, smart stock replenishment, and forecasting depending on the sales level and promotion. POS systems have given a huge boost to many of the retail business owners, because they not only speed up payment services, but also give real-time information about inventory and customers.
