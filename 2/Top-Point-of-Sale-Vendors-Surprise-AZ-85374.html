<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? The PDT stores your inventory count which enables you to upload it quickly into your Point of Sale software. It offers a choice of month-to-month or annual subscription plans for its POS software, and all of its plans support an unlimited number of users, customers and products. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>When you've got the basics of good inventory management and great customer service in place, you can devote mental energy to creating an immersive, interactive experience in your stores.

As is based on the same platform as our Hostel PMS, the two systems are totally integrated - and all revenue postings from the POS are pushed to the PMS (regardless of folio charge or cash payment data).</p>
<p>A reliable restaurant POS system is the difference between a coffee shop or bar that feels like a disorganized open market, and one where customers enjoy the convenience of ordering remotely from their mobile phones, or perhaps booking tables beforehand and then having their orders delivered right on time. Manage your sales, loyalty program and inventory from a smartphone or tablet. Any store that has a point of sale and point of purchase can use POS software.</p>
