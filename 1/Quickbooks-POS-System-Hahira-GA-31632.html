<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service. Using integrated technology to track data helps retailers catch discrepancies in pricing or cash flow that could lead to profit loss or interrupt sales. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>

Like our previous choice, TouchBistro is designed specifically for bars but also caters to breweries, cafes, pubs, and restaurants This POS solution offers mobility, cloud-based reporting, and excellent customer support among other advantages.</p>

As a reminder, the point of sale software is what you use in conjunction with POS hardware to run transactions.

Accurate wait times reduce walk-away customers and no-shows and let diners check-in before arrival.
