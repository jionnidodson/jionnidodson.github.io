<p>It is known that some of the most enterprising, enthusiastic and energetic people reside in the U.S. So it doesn't come as a surprise that many individuals of the U.S. invest their savings, hoping that with the returns, they will be in a position to commence a small but lucrative business. Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>
