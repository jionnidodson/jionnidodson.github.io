<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service. Using integrated technology to track data helps retailers catch discrepancies in pricing or cash flow that could lead to profit loss or interrupt sales. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
