<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. For a store that generates annual sales, the savings can be significant by utilising a POS system. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Omnichannel by design: Manhattan POS is equipped with all of the capabilities needed to turn stores into the center of your omnichannel experience: omni cart, omni fulfillment, returns, exchanges, cross-channel promotions, complete customer transaction and interaction history across channels, and more.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>

Our Point of Sale systems are compatible with all popular payment processors and gateways, while others give you one or two options.</p>

Some mobile POS systems allow the server to place orders right at the table, saving on time and reducing the chances of making a mistake.

Retailers can increase functionality by installing a network of data-capture devices, including card readers and barcode scanners.

<p>Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store. In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table. You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
<p>Harbortouch TablesideTM allows your restaurant's servers to input customer orders directly from the table via an Apple® iPad® for a dramatic increase in speed, service quality, and efficiency. Each time an item is ordered through the POS it is removed from the current inventory. Increase your sales and profitability by expanding your bar and alcohol business. For example, you may offer a self-service kiosk for patrons to purchase movie tickets, or you may have one to manage parking space time and payments.</p>
