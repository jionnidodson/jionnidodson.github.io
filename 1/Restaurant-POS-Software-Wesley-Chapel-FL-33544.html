<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. Even if you don't employ delivery staff, these third-party services will order, pick up, and deliver the food, generating more sales with little additional work. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost. Besides accepting credit and debit cards and cash, restaurants must accept gift cards and mobile payments to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service. Using integrated technology to track data helps retailers catch discrepancies in pricing or cash flow that could lead to profit loss or interrupt sales. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
