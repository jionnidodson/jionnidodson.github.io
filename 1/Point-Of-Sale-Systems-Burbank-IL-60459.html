<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>The system should facilitate the creation of multiple returns for one sales order at different time intervals. Along with an easy-to-use tablet point of sale, NCR Silver Pro Restaurant is a cloud-based POS software that delivers added benefits such as happy hour pricing, customized floor plans and house accounts valued by full service restaurants and pubs. If you plan to integrate your POS system with other software and services - such as accounting software, CMS platforms, customer loyalty programs and appointment management apps - you'll want to find out ahead of time if the integration costs extra, and whether it's a one-time or recurring fee.</p>
<h2>Using Technology To Improve The Bar And Grill Business Burbank</h2>
<p>An added benefit offered by this software is that it manages the time and attendance of your employees be they your waiters, chefs, managers, cooks, or restaurant employees.

<p>Heartland POS (formerly Dinerware) is a Global Payments company that offers multiple retail and restaurant POS systems for small and midsize businesses. Through the tablet's interface, customers can pay bills, sign receipts, and even offer tips for convenient cashless and paperless transactions. The most important use of this system to a business owner is its ability to allow your business to process credit card payments.</p>
<p>More established businesses can take advantage of advanced features such as kitchen display systems, digital menu boards, online ordering and self-ordering kiosks. This configurable, full-scale POS system gives your staff the mobility to do the job in all areas of the restaurant. Most POS software helps you stay aware of how your business is performing. The automation saved a retailer many hours in determining which departments contained the best selling items and how many sales dollars were generated.</p>
