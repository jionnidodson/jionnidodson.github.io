<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article. It helps to increase sales, improve service, and review reports to check on the performance of servers. Celerant, Intuit, MICROS Retail, Microsoft, NCR, Oracle, and SAP are the most popular POS software solution providers. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis. Mobile point of sale systems that utilize handheld tablets eliminate the clunky technology that typically stands between staff and guests.</p>

<p>This module powers centralized and automated inventory data that offers regular inventory checks, smart stock replenishment, and forecasting depending on the sales level and promotion. POS systems have given a huge boost to many of the retail business owners, because they not only speed up payment services, but also give real-time information about inventory and customers. Our POS solutions cover both in-store and online sales.</p>

<p>These registers have been replaced by technology known as point of sale (POS) systems; which nowadays are highly sophisticated and are the backbone of any business where sales are involved. The $29 Basic Shopify plan is an affordable option for smaller retail businesses, but only if you're selling products exclusively online. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye.</p>
