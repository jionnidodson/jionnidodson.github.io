<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. Cloud-based and on-premise solution that allows restaurants to streamline point-of-sale operations with scheduling, reporting and more. You can analyze sales data, figure out how well all the items on your shelves sell, and adjust purchasing levels accordingly. Beyond ringing up sales and accepting payments, you want a system that streamlines related processes such as inventory and customer management. A retail POS system may also include a barcode scanner and customer-facing screen.</p>
<p>TouchBistro restaurant POS system doesn't come with purchase-ordering and vendor management capabilities. Lavu utilizes advanced restaurant hardware and technology that include self-serve kiosks and digital menu boards, which make transacting and order taking quicker and more convenient.
