A Guest Manager iOS app can be added to Cake's basic POS software in order to allow online order management. The POS-integrated restaurant management system provides all the tools to run your frontend and backend operations. We present small retailers the freedom to sell, manage daily operations, and grow their retail store business in every way possible.

Comcash offers cloud-based POS software for retailers and a mobile POS app for the iPhone and iPod Touch that can be used as a line buster in retail stores or to take orders tableside in restaurants. Shifting from traditional front-house cash collection systems to efficient integrated systems with stock management and accounting capabilities, it offer dynamic controls to retailers to help them synchronize stocks with demands.</p>
