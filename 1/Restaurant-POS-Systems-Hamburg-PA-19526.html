The Offline Mode will not let you process integrated payments, edit & remove current customer profiles, or to discard and park sales. Our nFocus report dashboard gives you easy access to the data you need to manage employees, oversee operations and to make better business decsions. Our restaurant management systems have the same functionality and features, for a fraction of the price. It's an all-in-one, cloud-based restaurant management system designed to help you build, maintain and grow your business while continuously providing unforgettable customer experiences.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

Square is a common favorite of mobile businesses like food trucks and boutique retail shops. Either one of these will help brick and mortar retailers switch to an easier to use and more affordable POS. Another function of this mPOS is its connectivity to our Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Head Office (HO) software system.</p>
