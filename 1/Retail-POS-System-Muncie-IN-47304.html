<p>Run the world's best retail with Vend POS software + PayPal. Restaurants can choose high-end table management and reservations options or minimized features needed for fast food counters to food trucks. The restaurant POS industry charges per-month costs that vary depending on the number of terminals and locations, and whether you're only using software or need hardware as well. Because cashless payments are typically quicker and more efficient, which leave the customer with more time to do their thing.</p>
<p>Transactions are fully integrated into the sales process to allow for faster checkout experience for your customers. These features make it easy to accept payment from customers. Small restaurant businesses like cafes, pizzerias, nightclubs and bars can capitalize on the software's advanced menu creation and table mapping capabilities, while large franchises would be more interested in taking advantage of its real-time multi-location data syncing.</p>
