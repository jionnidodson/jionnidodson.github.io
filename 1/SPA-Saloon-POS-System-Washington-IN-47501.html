<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. POS vendors and retailers are working hard to standardise the technology behind POS systems, to drive down manufacturing and product costs. With open API's, these POS systems can allow integration platforms like DBSync to share the data with various other apps securely, thus avoiding double data entry. From taking orders in a coffee shop, booking hotel rooms, selling event tickets, retail stores, or restaurants.</p>
<p>So when you're at your favorite restaurant or retail shop, and you make a purchase, you are completing a point-of-sale (POS) or a point of purchase (POP) transaction. Loyalty and rewards programs will keep customers coming back time after time, and is a feature that retail POS systems can't handle. EPOS system is easy to use, and staff can be trained on it in 15 minutes. Advanced features of KORONA's automation and retail inventory management helps you identify and resolve problems to improve business operations.</p>

For old-school, on-premise systems, the cash register was the POS terminal. To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware.

If all you need is to have a total amount of cash in the drawer that sometimes matches to the amount of sales shown you probably don't need a point of sale system.</p>
