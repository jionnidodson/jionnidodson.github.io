But things can always go wrong, especially when you're dealing with back-office functions such as inventory or personnel management.</p>
<p>And unsurprisingly, 71% of Americans think that a credit or debit card is the most convenient payment method. It provides flexible reporting and cost & labor saving inventory management tools that help identify vulnerable areas of the business.
