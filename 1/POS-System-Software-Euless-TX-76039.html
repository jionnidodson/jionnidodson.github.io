<p>You can then send them special offers and sale notices with Odoo Mailing Register tax identifications for your business customers and give them invoices instantly (or send by email). Mobile apps have turned phones into portable payment kiosks, minimizing hardware requirements, while enabling retailers to take the transaction from the counter to the sales floor and beyond.
