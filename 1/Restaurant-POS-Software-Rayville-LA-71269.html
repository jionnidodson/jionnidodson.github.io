<p>Store owners, especially in these hard times, have to watch their pennies when investing in Point of Sale (POS) hardware. Included in the price of this type of system will include the necessary software, a printer, cash drawer, magnetic card swipe, and barcode scanner. Whether you're a full service, fine dining, fast food, or quick-service restaurant, you need a bar and restaurant POS system to manage your business. AccuCOUNT the inventory management system lets you handle pricing, take delivery orders wirelessly, and adjust inventory count.</p>

A popular mobile, industry-leading point-of-sale system, Lavu POS has a design specific to restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>It works just like any POS you'll find in a retail store, but because it's cloud based point of sale software (runs in a web browser) it works on any computer or iPad in the world. Set up custom buttons to accept cash, checks, gift cards or any payment type you want. Such software updates employee availability and manages employee time attendance. The Foodie365cloud is a ready to use restaurant software for fine dining restaurants, take away and quick service restaurants, bar, clubs and disco.</p>

<p>Accept payments using cash and options like Apple Pay and EMV for different customer transactions. The POS system allows you to view sales reports in real-time so you can track which products are selling. The Clover technology ensures a complete security system keeping the card data of your customers safe. Customers can proceed with credit cards, cash, check, debit cards, or maybe a gift card. Managing inventory in a retail business is very challenging because the stock is always in flux and the demand of items keeps shifting.</p>
