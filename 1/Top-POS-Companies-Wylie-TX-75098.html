<p>Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. Because traditional point of sale systems require you to run reports from an in-store terminal, your ability to make data-driven business decisions is limited to when you're at your business location. Vend enables ease of sale, regardless of whether retailers use Vend's responsive web-based POS on PC, Mac or the Vend Register iPad app.</p>
<p>The components of a POS system include hardware, software and operational features. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors. POS software or POS systems are located wherever a transaction occurs, which generally tends to mean the terminal that is used for checkouts.</p>
