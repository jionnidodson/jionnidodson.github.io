<p>This is due to the vast range of payment modes accepted by POS.A POS allows payment through Card, Cash, Gift Cards. It has various POS solutions tailored to how your business operates: Station for speed, Mini for a full POS that comes in a small size, Flex for processing payments beyond the counter and settle for an on-the-go swiping and tapping of payments using a mobile device. In addition to payroll management, the system features gratuity integrations.</p>
<p>It works just like any POS you'll find in a retail store, but because it's cloud based point of sale software (runs in a web browser) it works on any computer or iPad in the world.

<p>Also, since your revenues will rise, spending time on forecasting and analysis will have a bigger return on investment, so we added features of a POS system that will help you with forecasting as well. Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management. It is wise to use the POS computer for only sales transactions, reports, and inventory control, and isolate use of POS computers from general purpose activities.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>

It provides flexible reporting and cost & labor saving inventory management tools that help identify vulnerable areas of the business. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic).</p>
