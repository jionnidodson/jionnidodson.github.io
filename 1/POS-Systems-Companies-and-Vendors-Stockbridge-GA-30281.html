<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>

POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>

<p>Point of sale (POS) systems are checkout terminals that allow restaurants to process transactions, manage inventory, schedule employees, and more.
