<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. POS vendors and retailers are working hard to standardise the technology behind POS systems, to drive down manufacturing and product costs. With open API's, these POS systems can allow integration platforms like DBSync to share the data with various other apps securely, thus avoiding double data entry.
