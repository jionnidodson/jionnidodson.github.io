<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell. For a while, on-site POS software has been the norm for computerised POS systems , but it is now more common to use cloud-based or hybrid systems relying on both the internet and local hosting. We've been assisting and simplifying the daily routine of retail businesses since 2001.</p>

<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. These businesses should look for features like invoicing, e-commerce, and CRM. Proper use of these functions helps pinpoint the causes of inventory loss, reduces "out of stock" conditions and makes overall business management easier. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>

<p>Choosing the right point of sale (POS) system is vital for small businesses. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is leading the IoT revolution in retail systems, allowing for end-to-end inventory control, smooth tracking of goods through purchase, and eliminating the need for barcode scanners at the register. For example, if you're opening up a salon, you may want to look for a POS system that can handle complex scheduling and one that can manage payments and tipping to multiple individual employees.</p>
