<h3>Free POS Software For Your Retail Store Big Bear City California</h3>
<p>Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store.

You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that if you will be accepting debit and credit cards (which are required by most businesses), you need a service that will process all of your payments.
