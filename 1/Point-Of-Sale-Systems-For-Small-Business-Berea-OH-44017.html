And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems.

<p>For a bar POS system, you will need to either purchase or lease your hardware components, though industry experts recommend avoiding leasing, as contracts are lengthy and noncancelable. While we work hard to make our payments solution available to users around the world, Lightspeed users currently have access to a number of payment processing partners through the POS system. Today, with the help of a retail POS software you can simplify your billing, promotions, returns and much more.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>
