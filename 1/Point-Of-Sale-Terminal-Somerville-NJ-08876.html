<h3>How To Choose A POS System Somerville New Jersey</h3>
<p>Brick and mortar retailers are moving toward leaner systems that operate on tablets and smartphones, not complicated systems that cost thousands of dollars. A good POS system can speed up payment times, help waiters or bar staff to take large orders, and help kitchen staff to manage output effectively. You can't expect your clients to enjoy there shopping if they stand in a queue for 15 - 20 minutes, so be sure the point of sale (POS) retail side is fast.</p>
<p>We are honored to announce that the cross-platform, cross-channel POS and retail management software Retail ProÂ® was ranked number 1 retail mid-market POS in market share, global reach, innovation, and growth in the latest Retail Executive Advisory Program Research Study from IHL Group. If you are processing a layaway, you have to remove the merchandise from the floor yourself, because POS does not remove it from inventory until you actually sell it, and another sales associate may think you still have the item in stock.</p>

<p>Depending on which POS you choose, it can also solve issues that arise when sales and inventory numbers don't match up. You can automate markdowns and track them accurately, eliminating the register receipts headache at the end of the day. The QuickBooks Point of Sale software also allows you to expand your business by giving you the option to add more stores, lanes, and even to expand to the online business arena, where you can set up a fully customizable web store.</p>
<p>So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look. When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
