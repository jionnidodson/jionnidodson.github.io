<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?) Talking to other business owners is a good way to get an idea of the range of what's out there in terms of price.</p>
<p>Cashier Live works for all retail stores, but it has special features for boutiques, hardware stores and pharmacies. The scheduler is an online booking tool that allows your customers to book appointments for services when they purchase their Groupon deal. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location.</p>

A Mobile POS system or mPOS uses an electronic device such as a smartphone, tablet, or another mobile device as a terminal at which you can attach a credit card reader. Nobly POS is the #1 customer-rated iPad Point of Sale for restaurants. Now with an Internet POS - instead of relying on a physical drive - data is stored in the "cloud." This means it's spread among various servers throughout the web, which greatly decreases the chance of your data being lost.</p>
<p>Also, you'll want to have online access to see your labor costs and sales reports. There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically. It is important to anticipate your business growth and choose a bar POS system that will allow you to expand as you see fit. As a result of such extreme competitive pressures, modern POS has evolved far beyond a payment and accounting system to become not just point of sale, but also point of service, driving highly individualized interactions that consistently gratify customers in the moment.</p>
<p>Cost- Before finalizing the POS system, the user should consider the cost of it that includes the hardware and software price. This software has been around since 2008 and continues to be one of the best POS systems for retail. To get started, pair your POS software with one of our top inventory management software options. A vital element of POS hardware is the cash drawer. Payment is easy - at the beginning of the night, servers can start a tab in the POS for each customer, adding their name and payment card information so they don't have to ask again, allowing customers more convenience when they spend an evening in your bar.</p>
