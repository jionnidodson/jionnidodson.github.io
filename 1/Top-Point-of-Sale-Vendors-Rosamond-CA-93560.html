If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>POSIM (Point of Sale - Inventory Management) produces and supports point of sale and inventory management software for a variety of retail outlets across many industries. As consumers, we see barcodes used all the time: purchasing from any retail store, renting a car, attending major events, flying, and even going to the doctor. We focused our products on two vertical markets; Computer Service & Retail Point of Sales and Restaurant Point of Sales.</p>
<p>However, ShopKeep has a strong set of features that makes it suitable for smaller, quick-service restaurants. When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget. Some sales people need to be reminded that this is your choice and that you will choose the system which is right for your business. Many small restaurants still operate on a cash-only basis.</p>

<p>In this age of GrubHub, Seamless, Postmates, and other food delivery apps, creating an online ordering presence may seem daunting if you don't want to affiliate with one of the larger digital dining services.

Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
