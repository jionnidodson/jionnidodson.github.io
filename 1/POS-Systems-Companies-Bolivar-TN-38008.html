<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Springboard is a powerful, cloud-based POS software and management system for retailers. Having actual connected data means your sales associate can save the sale by placing an order to the other store using send sale capabilities. There are hundreds of companies that exist only to provide their bar and restaurant software to you.

As shrinkage due to customer theft and employee theft is one of the major expenses in most retail businesses, the modern retail POS technology has been geared toward preventing shrinkage.</p>
<p>So these POS systems have powerful tools for quickly taking orders in the front of the house and keeping up with the hectic operations and inventory needs in the back. Such a capability will ensure that the bar menu updates in real-time and in accordance with inventory changes. While some systems can handle the POS of both restaurants and retail businesses, many systems are designed specifically to handle the demanding needs of the latter.</p>
