<p>Labor Management and Payroll : A restaurant POS system can act as an employee time clock, with servers and staff signing in and out according to their schedules. In comparison, a customized restaurant POS system bundled with a restaurant POS PC and restaurant POS Software will allow your business do so much more. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong.</p>
