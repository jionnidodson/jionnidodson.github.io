<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Transactions are fully integrated into the sales process to allow for faster checkout experience for your customers. These features make it easy to accept payment from customers. Small restaurant businesses like cafes, pizzerias, nightclubs and bars can capitalize on the software's advanced menu creation and table mapping capabilities, while large franchises would be more interested in taking advantage of its real-time multi-location data syncing.</p>

<h3>Total Point Of Sale Retail Systems Clermont Florida</h3>
<p>Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. Because traditional point of sale systems require you to run reports from an in-store terminal, your ability to make data-driven business decisions is limited to when you're at your business location. Vend enables ease of sale, regardless of whether retailers use Vend's responsive web-based POS on PC, Mac or the Vend Register iPad app.</p>
<p>The Lightspeed restaurant POS system might be fairly costly to small businesses. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. Point of Success Special Edition is totally free restaurant software you can use today to make a real difference in your business. The primary operational use of the Point Of Sale system is to speed up the billing process for the customers at the store.</p>
<h3>Grocery POS Software Clermont FL 34711</h3>
<p>This is the most comprehensive package of all Vend's pricing bundles- so it's better suited to huge multi-store retailers and franchises. POS systems now integrate more seamlessly with other back-end applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) and inventory management. The POS system integrates with the countertop and tableside hardware and back-office management system. The system connects with your credit card processor so transactions can be processed in real time.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
