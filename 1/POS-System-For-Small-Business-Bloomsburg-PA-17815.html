<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?)
