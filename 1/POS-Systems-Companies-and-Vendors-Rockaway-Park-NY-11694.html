<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. To evolve into a valuable component of Retail 4.0, POS systems will need IoT connectivity. As the most popular mobile card reader company in the UK, this app is widely used by small shops who do not need very advanced features at their point of sale. It automatically updates the essential database from customers, products, inventory, sales, loyalty programs and labor. Cashier Live's software help businesses ring up sales with ease, as well as tracking inventory, managing staff, accessing data and generating reports.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>
