Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing.

<p>If you would like to do business in-person and online, some systems will give you the ability to create an online store that will pull items from an inventory database that is exactly the same as your physical store. The POS is straightforward and simple to use, yet it is an attractive system with time-saving features managers find appealing. If you operate a business with multiple employees, your POS software can help you manage them even when you are not around.</p>
