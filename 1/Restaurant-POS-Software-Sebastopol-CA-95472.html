<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Features include sales snapshots, void reports by employee, detailed credit card payment reports and detailed shift reports. Multi-store businesses, such as chains or franchises, will have access to the hierarchy feature, which allows businesses to easily manage and control simple to complex organisational business structures with accompanying access privileges. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.</p>
