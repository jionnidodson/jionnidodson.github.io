<p>Mobile-enabled and cloud-based omnichannel platform to speed up innovation and business change for midsize to large retail and restaurant businesses.

If the restaurant has primarily chosen a cloud-based POS system but their internet is not 100% reliable, they can connect an on-site server enabling the software to function when the internet is down and sync the data in the cloud when the internet is back up and running.</p>
<p>Point of sale system software applications can include applications for business operations, inventory management, employee management, revenue management systems, financial management, customer information management, and more.

With this software, you can increase your sales, track inventories, manage employees, and automate restaurant operations conveniently using your tablet. We're not the best fit for everyone, and if our retail point of sale won't meet the needs of your retail business, we'll be the first to tell you.</p>

<p>A big portion of these business owners are afraid of investing the time and money in a POS system to only end up regretting it because it just didn't work as they had hoped for.
