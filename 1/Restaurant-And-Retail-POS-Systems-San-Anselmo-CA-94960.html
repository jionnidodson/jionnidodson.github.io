<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>
