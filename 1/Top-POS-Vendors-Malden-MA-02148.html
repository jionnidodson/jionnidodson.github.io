<p>Inventory management is a necessity in every business, but more and more restaurants are realizing that it can be the difference between success and failure.

The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>
<h2>Best Retail POS Software Malden</h2>
