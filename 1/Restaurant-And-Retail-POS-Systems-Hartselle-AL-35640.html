Nobly POS is the #1 customer-rated iPad Point of Sale for restaurants. Now with an Internet POS - instead of relying on a physical drive - data is stored in the "cloud."

<p>The server stores all the data which relates to the Point of Sale system, allowing the information to be locked into one secure location.

<p>The sole purpose of any Point of Sale System setup by any store is to improve sales and profits by keeping track of all the products being sold or purchased at the retail store. You can close out or reconcile your cash drawer at any time and even have multiple shifts and multiple point of sale operators per shift. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server.</p>
<p>Now, customers can walk into a bar and grill having already placed their order before they left the office. You may think of point-of-sale (PoS) systems as just ordinary cash registers, but they're evolving to do much more. Chris Ligan, vice president of acquisitions at credit card processing company Auric , listed a few must-haves that every business, bar or otherwise, should look for in a POS system. Small businesses can take advantage of simple credit card processing, which is integrated with Quickbooks and encrypted for the protection of the business and its customers' data.</p>
