<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>Pros: Offers more features than most, including some customer relationship management functionality. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb. Revel , which was founded in 2010, is an iPad point-of-sale system ideal for larger restaurants such as franchises, catering services and restaurants with multiple locations. With RETAILvantage data capture is faster and more accurate, costs are lower, mistakes are minimized, and keeping a customer satisfied is much easier.</p>
<h2>Choosing The Right Retail POS System For Your Business West Helena</h2>
<p>This will enable them to drive inventory management, supply chain management, and customer relationship management apart from generating big data analytics that retailers can use for targeted marketing and sales campaigns. The POS software stores the information and maintains it within a database. No matter which processor you choose to use, you should be able to accept EMV chip cards and NFC payments such as Android Pay and Apple Pay.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between POS systems and cash registers , but generally speaking, functionality is typically uniform across platforms in the sense that a POS machine is used to ring up sales and to accept payments. With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Toast POS is one of the few providers of an Android POS system, which is more suitable for restaurants due to the flexibility and affordability of the Android infrastructure.</p>
<p>Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. Our seamlessly integrated payment processing system comes as an extension of PAR's restaurant POS software and is fully supported by our service and customer support infrastructure. When choosing a retail POS system, look for essential features like inventory management, employee management, real-time reporting and retail-centric features like customer management, loyalty programs, and matrix inventory tracking.</p>
<h2>Retail POS System Reviews West Helena AR</h2>
<p>When it come to the actual POS hardware, you need to make sure it is compatible with the software, and that the various pieces of hardware such as the barcode scanner, cash register, and credit card reader, are compatible. Easily access your sales, products and reports, and always have the latest data. The efficiency of such systems has decreased service times and increased efficiency of orders. Furthermore, POS Nation not only helps its clients with customizable software but it also provides them with the right hardware and peripherals for their business.</p>
<p>We focus on making the software work with the best and most commonly used retail hardware and we've heard from retailers using Vend successfully with printers we've haven't heard of. Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>
<p>Featuring an easy to use interface and sleek terminals, the solution enables restaurant staff to deliver exceptional services that grow repeat business. Union, a POS system designed for bars and restaurants, prides itself on being a fast system for busy businesses.

<h3>Best Hospitality POS Systems For Restaurants And Bars West Helena Arkansas</h3>

Pinogy is an easy-to-use retail POS system with a full suite of features, such as inventory, customer and multi-store management, reporting, and integrated credit card processing.

<p>For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards. OPUS automatically updates the sale and stock of the POS back to the retail ERP running at the head office. These applications would typically provide the same core functions, so watch out for other things like the hardware you would need to purchase on top of the software or which mobile platform it runs on. You would also do well to keep a keen eye on vendor reputation for providing timely updates and customer service.</p>

Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution. Since the system works through handheld devices connected to a main POS server, potential errors and omissions in the manual order taking process of the traditional point of sale restaurant are eliminated.</p>
