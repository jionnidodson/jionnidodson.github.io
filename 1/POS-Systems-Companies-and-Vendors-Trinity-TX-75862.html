<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? The PDT stores your inventory count which enables you to upload it quickly into your Point of Sale software. It offers a choice of month-to-month or annual subscription plans for its POS software, and all of its plans support an unlimited number of users, customers and products. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises.
