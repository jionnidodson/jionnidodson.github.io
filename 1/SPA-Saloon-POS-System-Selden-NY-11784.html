<p>In the Point of Sale QuickBooks software you are able to process non-posting transactions that promise customers something in the future, as Sales Orders, Work Orders and Layaways. This restaurant POS gives managers control over guest reservations, inventory management, staff management, and more. MPOS systems are used to process payments and may have other capabilities such as inventory management , loyalty programs, sales monitoring, reporting and much more. The software is what registers, processes and stores transaction details, but there are crucial differences in how it is stored and used between different POS software systems.</p>
<p>Transactions are fully integrated into the sales process to allow for faster checkout experience for your customers. These features make it easy to accept payment from customers. Small restaurant businesses like cafes, pizzerias, nightclubs and bars can capitalize on the software's advanced menu creation and table mapping capabilities, while large franchises would be more interested in taking advantage of its real-time multi-location data syncing.</p>
