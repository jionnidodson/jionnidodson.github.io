Cash management is a significant feature of POS software systems, but there are other key functions. For smaller retail businesses, we recommend our new retail POS solution, Harbortouch Checkout HT Retail is designed for larger business environments like department stores, grocery stores, bookstores, beer distributors, or stores with over 10,000 SKUs.
